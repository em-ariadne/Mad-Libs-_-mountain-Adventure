# Mad-Libs-_-mountain-Adventure
I created my first ever python program! This a combination of watching the 4 hours codingacedmy python video and looking up what projects i should start with. 
i made a few errors along the way, first print statements always need to lowercase, otherwise pycharm doesn't recognize it as a commmand
i also made lots of spacing errors that pycharm gave me a little yellow warning for, fixed all of tho's before even running the problem 

I am curious now about implementing my mad libs outside of the command prompt (which i figured out how to do will trying to find where my computer stored the file ) and the 
pycharm terminal. There must be a lot more steps between python code and actually getting someone else to use my program 

off on to my next adventure
(BTW i've decided to treat my read me section like a cringy coding diary, lol so 2007 but whatever, it will help me keep track of what i learned:P )
